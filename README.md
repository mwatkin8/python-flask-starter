# Python-flask-starter
This repository is meant to be a template for those who want to use python and flask to create a FHIR application. 

## Instructions
Python 3.6 should be installed and the following steps should be followed to run the example:

This tool uses a virtual environment to house the Flask dependencies. Activate the virtual environment using the command: `. venv/bin/activate`

A requirements.txt has also been included if you don't want to use a virtual environment or want to make your own.

Within the python-flask-starter directory, use the command: python app.py to activate the web server locally. Navigate your web browser to http://0.0.0.0:8080/ in order to view the example.

To deactivate venv when finished, use the command: `deactivate`
